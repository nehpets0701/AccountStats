# Account Stats
Account Stats allows you to enter usernames and get information on all of your accounts.
                    This includes information like the owner's name and email, and data such as account activity and followers.
                    The site featues a very easy to use interface where you simply type the usernames you are interested in and press enter.
                    You will immediately be greeted with the account stats. You can choose to use only one text box if you are only interested in one account,
                    or you can fill all the text boxes and get data on multiple accounts at once.
                    This was inspired from the fact that many websites exist that do this for only a single acccount at once.
                    Account Stats allows you to use multiple accounts from multiple sites simultaneously.
